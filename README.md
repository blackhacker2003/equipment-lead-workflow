# Equipment Lead Automation with Parseur AI & Zoho CRM

This repository documents a real-world AI workflow created by **Toby Cropper** that automates inbound email lead processing using **Parseur AI** and **Zoho CRM**.

## Overview

Sales teams often receive email leads containing unstructured lists of requested equipment. Manually entering these leads into a CRM is slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale.

This project demonstrates a working AI-assisted workflow that:
- Accepts inbound email leads
- Uses Parseur AI to extract structured data
- Automatically creates leads in Zoho CRM
- Handles variable email formats with high accuracy

The workflow proved to be **functional, easy to use, and nearly flawless**, with the only limitation being Parseur AI’s free-tier cap (20 emails), requiring a paid plan for sustained production use.
